\cvsection{Background}

\begin{cvparagraph}
With over a decade of experience as a (Cloud Native) Software Engineer, I have worked across the banking, e-commerce, and professional services industries.
My strong affinity for automation, testing, and observability enables me to excel in delivering and designing solutions in highly critical environments.

Leveraging expertise in Linux system administration, database management, software development, and cloud engineering, 
I build future-proof solutions that adhere to industry standards, with automation as a cornerstone in an agile fashion.
Known for creative problem-solving, thought leadership, innovation, and the implementation of DevOps principles, I effectively bridge the gap between developers and operations.

With a deep understanding of the entire software development lifecycle, I am able to help building and optimize software delivery pipelines and processes.

I am interested in working with the following technologies: \textbf{Linux}, \textbf{Talos}, \textbf{Kubernetes}, \textbf{Python}, \textbf{PHP}, \textbf{Golang}, \textbf{Grafana}, \textbf{PostgreSQL}, \textbf{Terraform}, \textbf{Ansible}, \textbf{Google Cloud}.
%Software engineer, musician, cat mom and tinkerer with a passion for automation, software development and Linux.

%I have over 11 years of experience in software development in the e-commerce and banking sector and over 6 years of experience as an automation, database, and Linux server administrator.

%In my spare time, I like to work on my home automation setup, play (bass) guitar, tinker with new technologies, learn new skills and work on open-source projects.
